# Problem Statement

Assist an architect in drawing the skyline of a city given the locations of the buildings
in the city. All buildings are rectangular in shape and they share a common bottom
(a flat surface). A building is specified by an ordered triplet (Li, Ri, Hi) where Li and
Ri are the left and right (x) coordinates, respectively, of the building i (0 < Li < Ri)
and Hi is the height of the building.
