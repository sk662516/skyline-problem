# Problem Statement

Assist an architect in drawing the skyline of a city given the locations of the buildings
in the city. All buildings are rectangular in shape and they share a common bottom
(a flat surface). A building is specified by an ordered triplet (Li, Ri, Hi) where Li and
Ri are the left and right (x) coordinates, respectively, of the building i (0 < Li < Ri)
and Hi is the height of the building.

### For example, the input can be as follows.

(33, 41, 5) <br>
(4, 9, 21)<br>
(30, 36, 9)<br>
(14, 18, 11)<br>
(2, 12, 14)<br>

(32, 37, 12)<br>
(7, 16, 7)<br>
(24, 27, 10)<br>
<br>
<b>The pseudocode/program should give the minimum number of points on graph (coordinates)
as output to assist the architect in drawing the skyline.<b>
